\title{Artificial data set resembling EU--SILC survey}

\description{

The data are artificially generated, just to show the application of the statistical matching techniques implemented in \pkg{StatMatch}.

\describe{
	\item{HH.P.id}{unique unit identifier of the type \code{aa.bb} where \code{aa} identifies the Household while \code{bb} identifies the household member}

	`3'=thinly populated area}
	\item{hsize}{integer, size of the household in which the person lives}
	\item{hsize5}{factor with 5 levels derived from \code{hsize}, where the 5th level `>=5' denotes 5 and more people in the household}
